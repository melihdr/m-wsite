            , created by mathematician John Conway, is a cellular automaton. It
            simulates the life and death of cells on a grid based on a few
            simple rules. Each cell can either be alive or dead, and the state
            of the grid changes over time in discrete steps called generations.

          <div className="game_of_life_subtitle">rules of the game of life</div>
          <div>
            At each step (generation), the next state of a cell is determined by
            the number of live neighbors it has (up to 8 surrounding cells):
            Underpopulation: A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.
            Survival: A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive.
            Overpopulation: A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.
            Reproduction: A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes
            alive. It's a zero-player game â€” after the initial setup, the grid
            evolves automatically following the rules. The system can show
            complex patterns and behaviors despite the simple rules.
